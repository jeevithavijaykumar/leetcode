#235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
#Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
#â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
# that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
